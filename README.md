## Assumptions

* Based on the documentation, I dont know the direction of the drill. The words "north/south and east/west deviation" and "depth" suggest a vertical direction, "horizontal drills" suggest horizontal direction. I simply assume just "direction" regardless what concrete direction it is.
* I assume, that tunnel is a theoretical tube, and it is not affected by the deviation of the drills. The dashed line around the tunnel surface shows the opposite, but the docu not mentioned anything, so I display it as a static circle.
* I assume, that the drills are only some kind of sample taker, pre drillers, so they don't affect the tunnel position.
* I assume, that the drills works independently from each other, but they get coordinate data always in the same depth or distance from the starting point.
* I assume that the drills should create a straight line, parallel with the tunnel. My work is to display the real life data with some deviation.
